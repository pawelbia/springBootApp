## Why libraryApp?

Not really unique, huh?             
   
Idea indeed not much unique but we can find out some interesting functions in 
this simple application like time calculations when we add/remove book, it can also 
calculate additional payment when the time has been exceeded.   
Also has a potential to add even more functions and relations.
